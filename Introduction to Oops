Oops - Stands for Object oriented programming structure

Using Oops concepts we can write a well structured code 
Easy to maintain and understand the code base 
we can achive reusebility and flexebility , scalability 

There are 4 features or pillers of object orirnted programming concepts

1) Encapsulation - Encapsulation is a mechanism through which we can bind the 
                   data members and member methods in a single unit with data hiding
  Encapsulation - we can achive Encapsulation using getter and setters 
                  without this we cannot achive Encapsulation..

  Encapsulation = Data hiding + abstraction 


2) abstraction - abstraction is nothing but hiding an implimentation and highlighting
                 set of servicess
                 or
                 hiding the background details and highlighting the servicess..
                 
   using an abstract classes we can achive abstraction 99 % 
   we cannot achive 100% abstraction using abstract classes

   Interfaces - using an Interfaces we can achive 100% abstraction
   becouse Interfaces have only abstract methods .

   abstract classes - have abstract and non abstract methods ..


3) Inheritance - Inheritance is nothing but whenever we want to create a new class 
                 from an existing class , that new class can access the properties 
                 and behaviours of existing class its called inheritance

   There are 4 types of Inheritance is present 
   1) simple / single Inheritance
   2) multi -level inheritance
   3) multiple inheritance 
   4) Hiraricle inheritance 


4) Polymorphism - its a greek word whose meaning is same object having a different bihaviour

   poly means - many 
   morphism means - form  
    = many form 

 There are 2 types of polymorphism 
  1) Compiletime polymorphism
  2) Run time polymorphism

  NOTE : I will explain all these concepts with code .......come lets dive into oops
